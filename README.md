## Contributing

Zoe is Free and Open Source Software. We welcome bug reports and patches from everyone across the galaxy. However, keep in mind that Zig governance is BDFN (Benevolent Dictator For Now) which means that David George Williams has final say on the design and implementation of everything.

To contribute:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

Remember, in space, no one can hear you code... but they can read your commit messages!
